# <week1-miniproject>

## Description

My goal of this project was to refractor code for a webpage to add html semantics to the code. The original code had mainly div semantics, which is not the the optimal solutuion. By refractoring the code I learned more about html semantics, which ones to use where, and how to make sure the CSS stylesheet matches the html semantics.


## Usage
